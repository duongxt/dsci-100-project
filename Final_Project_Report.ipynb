    "\n",
    "The Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) is an Artificial Intelligence research group from the Department of Computer Science at UBC, whose current research involves work in generative modelling, probabilistic programming, generative modeling and Bayesian interference to advance AI (Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence, n.d.). For this data analysis project, the data used will be from PLAI's leading program for video game AI learning _Plaicraft_, where players' actions were recorded as they engaged with the game (Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence, n.d.). The problem brought up for us to examine in this coding challenge was to aid in ensuring PLAI have sufficient resources to provide optimal experiences for players. The research question we chose to approach this issue is:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Question 1: What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we attempt to answer a more specific research question from the one above, and hence our research question is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can we predict the whether a player will subscribe to the game newsletter based on their hours played, age and experience level?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we focus the data into three variables, age and experience level, then use a predictive algorithm to find what conditions make a player more likely to subscribe to a game newsletter.\n"

    "In the table below, there are 9 columns and 196 rows.\n",
    "The variables describe the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.`experience` is a categorical variable, with levels of experience, where `Veteran` is the highest, followed by `Pro`, `Regular` and `Amateur`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `subscribe` is a boolean variable, indicating the whether players have subscribed to the newsletter of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `hashedEmail` is an ID variable that refers to the players email.\n",

    "4. `played_hours` is a quantitative variable - refers to the number of hours played on the game.\n",

    "5. `name` refers to the name of the player.\n",

    "6. `gender` indicates that of the player, and `age` is their age.\n",

    "Some of the columns seem to not provide the information we want:\n",
    "* `individualId` and `organizationName`has no values of data (NaN columns), and so would not be useful in answering our question.\n",
    "* `hashedEmail` and `name` have information about the players , but is not relevant nor useful to answer a possible questions because of the unclear values of data in the column.\n",
    "* `experience` is unclear with the rankings of each player, as we do not know whether \"Veteran\" deems as better experiences that a \"Pro\" in this game, so we might have to assume.\n",
    "* The `played_hours` variable is incredibly skewed with many players near 0 hours, and `age` contains an outlier (age 91), which may affect distance-based models like KNN."

    "The model achieved a 72% accuracy where it performed better on subscribed players compared to non-subscribed players. The low accuracy for predicting `False`, the non-subscribed players (`0.27`), indicates many that the model has difficulty identifying players who are not subscribed even after upsampling. However, the high recall for predicting `True`, players who are subscribed, and the oervall higher accuracy of `0.83` for the positive test variable (in this case, `True` because we want to know when players are subscribed), suggests that the model works decently well in answering the question of interest. The overall accuracy of the model is `0.72`, also suggesting that it works well for the small amount of data available to train it with."

    "Referring back to our research question: \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Can we predict the whether a player will subscribe to the game newsletter based on their hours played, age and experience level?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Does age affect whether Players are likely to be subscribed or not?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings from `Figure 1` Panel A (Player Age Distribution) indicate that the most concentrated age group is between 15 and 25 years old. Additionally, `Figure 2` Panel A (Plot of Hours Played vs. Age of Players) shows that younger players generally spend more time playing than older players. Players aged 35 and under make up the majority both in the total number of players and in the total time played. This age range includes more orange bars (indicating a player had subscribed) compared to blue bars (indicating a player had not subscribed), visually suggesting a possible correlation although the model does not demonstrate a strong predictive capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Does player experience affect whether they are subscribed or not?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Figure 1` Panel C (Player Experience Distribution) suggests that players are fairly evenly distributed across the different experience levels. `Figure 2` Panel B (Plot of Hours Played vs. Experience Level) also shows that experience does not have much impact on the amount of time players spend in the game. Overall, the accuracy (72%) suggests age, hours played, and experience level are not strong predictors of subscription. More revealing variables may not be shown in the data set. The orange bars (indicating a player had subscribed) and blue bars (indicating a player had not subscribed) are also very similar across all experience levels, suggesting that experience does not indicate an association in regards to subscription in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For `age`, younger players were hypothesized to have both a higher player count and more hours played compared to older players, and both predictions were correct. We also expected younger players to show a higher subscription rate. These results make sense, as younger individuals typically spend more time gaming and tend to be more invested in it than older players. For `experience`, players with higher ranks were hypothesized to have more hours played and a higher subscription percentage. However, hours played and subscription rates were spread fairly evenly across all experience levels. A potential limitation is that model comparison was not done before and after oversampling, which could potentially reduce scores of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "These findings could help the developers understand what changes might make the game better. Since younger players indicate increased hours played and are more likely to subscribe to the game newsletter, the developers should tailor updates or features to fit them as their target audience. The developers could also use this information to make adjustments, like trying different subscription prices to see what works best, or making the game easier and more enjoyable for older players so they might play more.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings can aid the newsletter in marketing its product towards an audience that houses these traits of age and experience, leading to a greater rate of attention from players of the game and, therefore, more substantial rates of subscription. Future research stemming from our findings could include developers might want to look into why younger players subscribe more and what parts of the game are attracting them and how the newsletter might promote its product to players outside of this demographic to recruit subscriptions from players in other age groups and experience levels. Testing other models (like linear regression, or KNeighborsregression) may reveal other patterns overlooked by KNN."
